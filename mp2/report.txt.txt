I have successfully completed all parts of this mp.

The documentation for this mp is very detailed and the mp itself helped me better understand the inner-workings of 
garbled circuits. In particular, the gate-by-gate decryption process showed me how the garbling protocol satisties
the security properties that are mentioned in lectures. The lecture materials, although sometimes confusing,
are very interesting after one takes the time to digest and apply them.
