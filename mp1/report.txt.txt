I have finished all the parts for mp1 except part 5.
I have tried to implement the range_prover and verifier function as it was described in the lecture notes and
the piazza hints, but it was not successful. While I understand the mathematics behind range proof, I cannot
fully translate the concept into ZK proofs.
Other parts of the mp really complemented the theories we have learned in class, they helped me understand
most of the materials in the lectures. It is interesting to know how these neat mathematical theories are
applied in real life to help us build secure messaging/transaction systems.
While the course materials might not be that intuitive and students are often left in confusion, I appreciate Professor
Miller's effort in explaining the concepts to us. This mp definitely helped expanded my mental capacity and cleared out
much of the confusion I had before.
