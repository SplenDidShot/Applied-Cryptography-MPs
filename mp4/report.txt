Setps:
I first tried to understand the encryption scheme used in pbp.py to see how the padding affected the polynomial.
I then went through a trial-and-error phase of tweaking the input values for the coppersmith attack function provided
on the github repo.
I tested out my methods by encrypting a simple message with my own rsa keypair and pbp, and decrypting the ciphertext
with the attack I implemented.
After that, I worked out the formatting of the plaintext in order to get a uncorrupted pdf file.
Understanding the theory behind LLL based attack took me the longest time as there were multiple implementations and
multiple papers that all had slight variations in their algorithms. The process also required some luck due to the 
discrete nature of cryptography. In particular, the paper from Alexander May and the github repo were most helpful in
completing this assignment, as they explained in details what each input for the coppersmith attack was about.
